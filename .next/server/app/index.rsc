3:T443,Adding another wrinkle to Topuria's trajectory is the possibility of superfights outside his division. Islam Makhachev, the lightweight champion, has expressed interest in facing Topuria after his upcoming bout, framing it as a potential cross-divisional clash that would attract global attention. [MMA Fighting](https://www.mmafighting.com/latest-news/400424/islam-makhachev-open-to-superfight-with-ilia-topuria-after-fighting-jack-della-maddalena) reported that such a fight could even headline a pay-per-view outside the United States, leveraging both fighters' international appeal.
All of this makes Topuria's career projection hard to predict. Will he choose the risky but legacy-defining path of facing Tsarukyan? Will he opt for a blockbuster but stylistically easier fight like Pimblett? Or will he angle for crossover fights that maximize exposure but risk accusations of cherry-picking?
What's certain is that Ilia Topuria stands at a crossroads in 2025. Every choice—from opponents to timing—will shape whether he is remembered as a fleeting champion or as one of the greats.4:T4b2,Few names in MMA spark frustration among fighters and fans like Steve Mazzagatti, Dave Seljestad, and Mario Yamasaki.
- **Steve Mazzagatti** has been on the receiving end of harsh criticism from UFC President Dana White, who once called him *"dangerous with continued incompetence"*. His history of late stoppages and questionable calls has been documented in outlets like [Bleacher Report](https://bleacherreport.com/articles/1674811-dana-white-referee-steve-mazzagatti-is-dangerous-with-continued-incompetence).
- **Dave Seljestad** recently came under fire during UFC 307 for poorly handled eye pokes and untimely separations, prompting backlash from fans and fighters alike. [MMA News](https://www.mmanews.com/news/ufc/fans-slam-referee-eye-pokes-separations-ufc-307-fight/) reported the incident as a turning point in the call for higher officiating standards.
- **Mario Yamasaki** is notorious for letting fighters endure unnecessary punishment. His infamous "be a warrior" stance drew heavy criticism, and his reluctance to step in quickly has led to accusations of negligence.
Together, these referees represent the UFC's officiating low points—moments that shape not only fights but careers.0:["gsh3HEZtwBzoE1M2DF2kj",[[["",{"children":["__PAGE__",{}]},"$undefined","$undefined",true],["",{"children":["__PAGE__",{},["$L1",["$","div",null,{"className":"min-h-screen","children":[["$","$L2",null,{"articles":[{"id":"formula-drift-prospec-2025-final-results","title":"Formula Drift PROSPEC Championship: Cody Buchanan Crowned 2025 Champion in Utah","slug":"formula-drift-prospec-2025-final-results","author":"Abeelyn","category":"Motorsports","date":"2025-08-19","meta_title":"Formula Drift PROSPEC 2025: Cody Buchanan Wins Championship","meta_description":"Cody Buchanan claims the 2025 Formula Drift PROSPEC title in Utah after rivals exit early.
