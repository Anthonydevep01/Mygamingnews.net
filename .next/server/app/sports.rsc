3:T443,Adding another wrinkle to Topuria's trajectory is the possibility of superfights outside his division. Islam Makhachev, the lightweight champion, has expressed interest in facing Topuria after his upcoming bout, framing it as a potential cross-divisional clash that would attract global attention. [MMA Fighting](https://www.mmafighting.com/latest-news/400424/islam-makhachev-open-to-superfight-with-ilia-topuria-after-fighting-jack-della-maddalena) reported that such a fight could even headline a pay-per-view outside the United States, leveraging both fighters' international appeal.
All of this makes Topuria's career projection hard to predict. Will he choose the risky but legacy-defining path of facing Tsarukyan? Will he opt for a blockbuster but stylistically easier fight like Pimblett? Or will he angle for crossover fights that maximize exposure but risk accusations of cherry-picking?
What's certain is that Ilia Topuria stands at a crossroads in 2025. Every choice—from opponents to timing—will shape whether he is remembered as a fleeting champion or as one of the greats.4:T4b2,Few names in MMA spark frustration among fighters and fans like Steve Mazzagatti, Dave Seljestad, and Mario Yamasaki.
- **Steve Mazzagatti** has been on the receiving end of harsh criticism from UFC President Dana White, who once called him *"dangerous with continued incompetence"*. His history of late stoppages and questionable calls has been documented in outlets like [Bleacher Report](https://bleacherreport.com/articles/1674811-dana-white-referee-steve-mazzagatti-is-dangerous-with-continued-incompetence).
- **Dave Seljestad** recently came under fire during UFC 307 for poorly handled eye pokes and untimely separations, prompting backlash from fans and fighters alike. [MMA News](https://www.mmanews.com/news/ufc/fans-slam-referee-eye-pokes-separations-ufc-307-fight/) reported the incident as a turning point in the call for higher officiating standards.
- **Mario Yamasaki** is notorious for letting fighters endure unnecessary punishment. His infamous "be a warrior" stance drew heavy criticism, and his reluctance to step in quickly has led to accusations of negligence.
Together, these referees represent the UFC's officiating low points—moments that shape not only fights but careers.0:["gsh3HEZtwBzoE1M2DF2kj",[[["",{"children":["sports",{"children":["__PAGE__",{}]}]},"$undefined","$undefined",true],["",{"children":["sports",{"children":["__PAGE__",{},["$L1",["$","div",null,{"className":"min-h-screen py-12","children":["$","div",null,{"className":"max-w-7xl mx-auto px-4 sm:px-6 lg:px-8","children":[["$","div",null,{"className":"text-center mb-12","children":[["$","h1",null,{"className":"text-4xl md:text-5xl font-bold text-gray-900 dark:text-white mb-4","children":"Sports News"}],["$","p",null,{"className":"text-xl text-gray-700 dark:text-gray-300 max-w-3xl mx-auto","children":"Stay updated with the latest sports news, athlete updates, and sporting events coverage."}]]}],["$","div",null,{"className":"grid grid-cols-1 md:grid-cols-2 lg:grid-cols-3 gap-8","children":[["$","$L2","ilia-topuria-fighting-2025",{"article":{"id":"ilia-topuria-fighting-2025","title":"Is Ilia Topuria Fighting in 2025?","slug":"ilia-topuria-fighting-2025","author":"Benji","category":"Sports","date":"2025-08-19","meta_title":"Is Ilia Topuria Fighting in 2025?

But questions are emerging about whether his team is steering him toward more favorable matchups rather than the toughest challenges available.\nReports suggest that Topuria's camp is considering names like Paddy Pimblett, a popular but less proven lightweight, as a possible opponent. According to [Cageside Press](https://cagesidepress.com/2025/08/11/arman-tsarukyan-ilia-topuria-wants-easy-fight-with-pimblett-gaethje), this has drawn criticism from fans who believe the champion should be defending against the most dangerous contenders in his division."},{"heading_h2":"Why Nobody Wants to Face Arman Tsarukyan","text":"One of those dangerous contenders is Arman Tsarukyan. Known for his relentless pace and technical wrestling, Tsarukyan has earned a reputation as one of the most avoided fighters in the lightweight division. Fighters know that stepping into the Octagon with him means enduring constant pressure and a grinding fight style that breaks opponents mentally and physically.\nAs highlighted by [talkSPORT](https://talksport.com/mma/3503199/paddy-pimblett-ufc-future-hint-ilia-topuria), Tsarukyan is openly campaigning for his title shot, but without a marquee name or mainstream following, he remains on the outside looking in. For Topuria, facing Tsarukyan would be the kind of matchup that cements a legacy—but also the kind of risk that champions often hesitate to accept early in their reign."},{"heading_h2":"Will Justin Gaethje Retire Without a Title Fight?","text":"Another storyline complicating the lightweight picture is the uncertain future of Justin Gaethje. The former interim champion has hinted that retirement is on the table if he doesn't receive a legitimate shot at UFC gold.\nGaethje's reputation as one of the UFC's most violent and entertaining fighters makes him a draw, but his recent setbacks have put him outside the top contenders' circle. Still, should Topuria entertain Gaethje as a potential opponent, it could offer the UFC a marketable fight—albeit one that some would view as skipping over tougher challengers like Tsarukyan."},{"heading_h2":"Ilia Topuria's Unpredictable Career Projection","text":"$3"}],"description":"Ilia Topuria's UFC title reign faces big questions in 2025.

In just two weeks, he won two fights in two weight classes, a feat rarely accomplished in modern MMA. Over the years, he continued his streak, toppling ranked opponents and establishing himself as a contender.\nBy UFC 319, Chimaev's résumé spoke for itself: undefeated, ruthless, and carrying momentum that few fighters in history have sustained.
