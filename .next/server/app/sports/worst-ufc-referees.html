- **Steve Mazzagatti** has been on the receiving end of harsh criticism from UFC President Dana White, who once called him *"dangerous with continued incompetence"*. His history of late stoppages and questionable calls has been documented in outlets like <a href="https://bleacherreport.com/articles/1674811-dana-white-referee-steve-mazzagatti-is-dangerous-with-continued-incompetence" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="text-blue-400 hover:text-blue-300 underline">Bleacher Report</a>.
- **Dave Seljestad** recently came under fire during UFC 307 for poorly handled eye pokes and untimely separations, prompting backlash from fans and fighters alike. <a href="https://www.mmanews.com/news/ufc/fans-slam-referee-eye-pokes-separations-ufc-307-fight/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="text-blue-400 hover:text-blue-300 underline">MMA News</a> reported the incident as a turning point in the call for higher officiating standards.
- **Mario Yamasaki** is notorious for letting fighters endure unnecessary punishment. His infamous "be a warrior" stance drew heavy criticism, and his reluctance to step in quickly has led to accusations of negligence.
Together, these referees represent the UFC's officiating low points—moments that shape not only fights but careers.</div></div><div class="mb-6"><h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-gray-900 dark:text-white mt-8 mb-4">When Bad Refereeing Changes Careers</h2><div class="text-gray-300 dark:text-gray-300 text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4 prose prose-lg dark:prose-invert">The consequences of poor refereeing go far beyond a single fight result. Late stoppages risk permanent damage to fighters, while premature ones undermine years of training and preparation. For example, questionable enforcement of rules around fouls has repeatedly left fighters and their camps furious. <a href="https://talksport.com/mma/3499714/ufc-fighter-illegal-move-defeat-kiefer-crosbie/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="text-blue-400 hover:text-blue-300 underline">talkSPORT</a> highlighted a case where an illegal move changed the outcome of Kiefer Crosbie's fight, sparking debate over referee accountability.
Every mistake affects more than just the fighters—it alters rankings, paydays, fan perception, and in some cases, entire careers.</div></div><div class="mb-6"><h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-gray-900 dark:text-white mt-8 mb-4">Are UFC Referees Held Accountable?</h2><div class="text-gray-300 dark:text-gray-300 text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4 prose prose-lg dark:prose-invert">Despite repeated controversies, the system for referee accountability remains opaque. Fans and media outlets argue for more oversight, yet governing bodies like athletic commissions often recycle the same officials regardless of their track records.
Some fighters and commentators have called for reforms, including stricter performance reviews, suspension for repeated mistakes, and more extensive referee training programs. The backlash from UFC 307 and past incidents involving Mazzagatti and Yamasaki are fueling those discussions louder than ever.</div></div><div class="mb-6"><h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-gray-900 dark:text-white mt-8 mb-4">Conclusion: A Call for Higher Standards</h2><div class="text-gray-300 dark:text-gray-300 text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4 prose prose-lg dark:prose-invert">Referees in combat sports carry a heavy burden—the safety of athletes and the integrity of competition rest in their hands. While mistakes are inevitable, consistent lapses from certain referees have left lasting stains on the UFC's reputation.
As fighters continue to speak out and fans demand higher standards, the pressure is mounting on the UFC and athletic commissions to ensure only the most competent officials oversee fights. Until then, names like Mazzagatti, Seljestad, and Yamasaki will remain symbols of what fans dread most: the wrong call at the wrong time.</div></div></div></div><div class="lg:w-80 flex-shrink-0"><div

According to [Cageside Press](https://cagesidepress.com/2025/08/11/arman-tsarukyan-ilia-topuria-wants-easy-fight-with-pimblett-gaethje), this has drawn criticism from fans who believe the champion should be defending against the most dangerous contenders in his division.\"},{\"heading_h2\":\"Why Nobody Wants to Face Arman Tsarukyan\",\"text\":\"One of those dangerous contenders is Arman Tsarukyan. Known for his relentless pace and technical wrestling, Tsarukyan has earned a reputation as one of the most avoided fighters in the lightweight division.

For Topuria, facing Tsarukyan would be the kind of matchup that cements a legacy—but also the kind of risk that champions often hesitate to accept early in their reign.\"},{\"heading_h2\":\"Will Justin Gaethje Retire Without a Title Fight?\",\"text\":\"Another storyline complicating the lightweight picture is the uncertain future of Justin Gaethje.

Still, should Topuria entertain Gaethje as a potential opponent, it could offer the UFC a marketable fight—albeit one that some would view as skipping over tougher challengers like Tsarukyan.\"},{\"heading_h2\":\"Ilia Topuria's Unpredictable Career Projection\",\"text\":\"$8\"}],\"description\":\"Ilia Topuria's UFC title reign faces big questions in 2025.
