## Clair Obscur: Expedition 33 Crowned Game of the Year

The biggest headline of the night came from *Clair Obscur: Expedition 33* securing the GOTY title. The game’s innovative combat, painterly aesthetic, and emotional storytelling pushed it above a highly competitive field.

Coverage from [The Verge](https://www.theverge.com/news/843340/clair-obscur-expedition-33-wins-game-of-the-year) emphasizes how the game resonated with both critics and audiences through its worldbuilding and bold artistic vision—traits often associated with GOTY-caliber titles.

For a game that began as a cult favorite during previews, this win catapulted it directly into mainstream recognition.

## A Personal Take on the Stream: Beautiful, Loud, and Very Expensive

The show itself was a spectacle of sound and scale. The orchestra delivered one of the best live medleys the awards have seen, jumping from sweeping fantasy themes to electrifying action motifs. The performers elevated every moment they touched, reminding viewers why music remains such a core part of gaming culture.

But the stream also carried some familiar frustrations. Ads dominated the pacing, sometimes overtaking the ceremony’s emotional highs. With advertising slots reportedly reaching **$450,000 for 60 seconds**, the commercial density was impossible to ignore.

It’s understandable—the show has grown, the audience has grown, and the corporate investment has grown—but many viewers felt the balance tipped more toward promotion than celebration.

Still, the energy remained strong, and the transitions between live performances, winners, and premieres were smoother than in previous years.

## What Games Will Define 2026?

The Game Awards 2025 left us with exciting teases and a jam-packed year ahead. Based on announcements, industry insight, and ongoing development cycles, here are some of the games expected to dominate conversations in 2026:

*   🔥 **GTA 6** — Finally launching in late 2026
*   📦 **Death Stranding 2**
*   🌌 **Metroid Prime 4**
*   🐉 **Dragon Age: The Veilguard** (Post-launch updates & DLC)
*   ⚔️ **Fable** (New trailers expected)
*   🎨 **Clair Obscur: Expedition 33** (Follow-up content)
*   🕶️ **Perfect Dark** (Reboot)
*   🕷️ **Hollow Knight: Silksong** (DLC)

If this year’s ceremony showed anything, it’s that creativity in gaming is far from slowing down. 2026 could be one of the industry's most ambitious years yet.
