**Is the new UFC champion defending his title this 2025? Arman Tsarukyan is looking for his chance.**

## Is Ilia Topuria Looking for "Easy" Fights?

Ilia Topuria's meteoric rise to UFC gold was defined by his dominant performances and sharp fight IQ. But questions are emerging about whether his team is steering him toward more favorable matchups rather than the toughest challenges available.

Reports suggest that Topuria's camp is considering names like Paddy Pimblett, a popular but less proven lightweight, as a possible opponent. According to [Cageside Press](https://cagesidepress.com/2025/08/11/arman-tsarukyan-ilia-topuria-wants-easy-fight-with-pimblett-gaethje), this has drawn criticism from fans who believe the champion should be defending against the most dangerous contenders in his division.

## Why Nobody Wants to Face Arman Tsarukyan

One of those dangerous contenders is Arman Tsarukyan. Known for his relentless pace and technical wrestling, Tsarukyan has earned a reputation as one of the most avoided fighters in the lightweight division. Fighters know that stepping into the Octagon with him means enduring constant pressure and a grinding fight style that breaks opponents mentally and physically.

As highlighted by [talkSPORT](https://talksport.com/mma/3503199/paddy-pimblett-ufc-future-hint-ilia-topuria), Tsarukyan is openly campaigning for his title shot, but without a marquee name or mainstream following, he remains on the outside looking in. For Topuria, facing Tsarukyan would be the kind of matchup that cements a legacy—but also the kind of risk that champions often hesitate to accept early in their reign.

## Will Justin Gaethje Retire Without a Title Fight?

Another storyline complicating the lightweight picture is the uncertain future of Justin Gaethje. The former interim champion has hinted that retirement is on the table if he doesn't receive a legitimate shot at UFC gold.

Gaethje's reputation as one of the UFC's most violent and entertaining fighters makes him a draw, but his recent setbacks have put him outside the top contenders' circle. Still, should Topuria entertain Gaethje as a potential opponent, it could offer the UFC a marketable fight—albeit one that some would view as skipping over tougher challengers like Tsarukyan.

## Ilia Topuria's Unpredictable Career Projection

Adding another wrinkle to Topuria's trajectory is the possibility of superfights outside his division. Islam Makhachev, the lightweight champion, has expressed interest in facing Topuria after his upcoming bout, framing it as a potential cross-divisional clash that would attract global attention. [MMA Fighting](https://www.mmafighting.com/latest-news/400424/islam-makhachev-open-to-superfight-with-ilia-topuria-after-fighting-jack-della-maddalena) reported that such a fight could even headline a pay-per-view outside the United States, leveraging both fighters' international appeal.

All of this makes Topuria's career projection hard to predict. Will he choose the risky but legacy-defining path of facing Tsarukyan? Will he opt for a blockbuster but stylistically easier fight like Pimblett? Or will he angle for crossover fights that maximize exposure but risk accusations of cherry-picking?

What's certain is that Ilia Topuria stands at a crossroads in 2025. Every choice—from opponents to timing—will shape whether he is remembered as a fleeting champion or as one of the greats.
