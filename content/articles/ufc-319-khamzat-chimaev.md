**Chechnya's Chimaev, now 15-0 as a pro, got his first shot at gold in the main event of UFC 319, taking on increasingly impressive champion Dricus Du Plessis of South Africa. The challenger entered the Octagon as a considerable betting favorite, but many expected him to run into trouble against the champion.**

## Who is The Chechnya's Wolf?

Khamzat Chimaev, often called "The Wolf", was born in Chechnya before moving to Sweden, where his MMA journey began. Known for his relentless grappling and ferocious striking, Chimaev quickly made a name for himself in the UFC. According to his [official biography](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Khamzat_Chimaev), his undefeated record across multiple weight classes has set him apart as one of the promotion's most dominant athletes.

His fighting style combines unyielding pressure with precise control, often overwhelming opponents before they can mount any offense.
