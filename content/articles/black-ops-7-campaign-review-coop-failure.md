**This year’s game, Black Ops 7, expands the campaign in new and exciting ways. For one thing, it’s a cooperative campaign. That, in and of itself, is nothing new. Black Ops III also had a 4-player co-op campaign back in 2015. But this iteration of co-op is much different and more expansive. It’s also . . . a huge disappointment. I’m still a bit baffled at how many mistakes this campaign makes and how unlike a Call Of Duty campaign it feels in the end.**

## Co-Op Ambition Meets Fragmented Execution
On paper, the idea of a fully co-op Black Ops campaign sounds innovative. The mission structure, enemy density, and objectives were clearly designed for four players working in sync. However, the execution reveals glaring issues that undermine the overall experience.

As noted in [Forbes campaign review](https://www.forbes.com/sites/erikkain/2025/11/14/call-of-duty-black-ops-7-campaign-review), BO7’s campaign suffers heavily when played solo. Missions become repetitive, checkpoints are nonexistent, and the pacing feels disjointed—almost as if the game expects players to fill in the gaps through multiplayer chaos rather than narrative cohesion.

The constant requirement for an online connection only amplifies the frustration. According to [always-online and no checkpoints analysis](https://www.tomshardware.com/video-games/call-of-duty-black-ops-7-campaign-requires-a-constant-online-connection-and-has-zero-checkpoints-mission-levels-are-designed-for-four-necessitating-repetitive-tasks-if-you-play-alone), any disruption in connectivity resets mission progress entirely. This design choice strips the campaign of its cinematic roots and transforms it into something closer to a live-service corridor shooter.

## Where the Campaign Loses All Sense of Identity
Narratively, Black Ops 7 makes bold swings—sometimes too bold. The surreal, psychedelic storytelling elements clash with the game's grounded military tone, resulting in an experience that feels more confused than creative. [Trippy mess campaign review](https://hiphopwired.com/2914740/call-of-duty-black-ops-7-campaign-review-trippy-mess) describes the campaign as a “trippy mess,” and that verdict isn’t unfair.

Character arcs feel abrupt, major plot points seem disconnected, and the pacing jumps wildly between thematic styles. Instead of delivering a cohesive espionage thriller, BO7 stumbles through genre experimentation without fully committing to any one vision.

For long-time fans of the series' signature structure—high-stakes setpieces, memorable moments, and a clear narrative thread—this entry feels unrecognizable.

## “Open Combat” Missions Make an Unwanted Return
One of the most controversial design decisions is the revival of “open combat” missions. While these were meant to encourage player creativity in Modern Warfare III, they were widely criticized for feeling undercooked and repetitive. Unfortunately, the problems remain.

Open combat sections in BO7 often feel like filler content. Enemy AI behaves inconsistently, objectives lack clarity, and the sandbox mechanics fall short of providing meaningful choice. These missions drag the pacing down and highlight how unfocused the campaign’s overall structure is.

As launch-day analysis from [TechRadar live coverage](https://www.techradar.com/news/live/call-of-duty-black-ops-7-launch-live) notes, the campaign’s blend of linear and open-ended missions ultimately creates an identity crisis.

## Zombies Mode: A Silver Lining — But Not Enough
If there’s one mode that salvages the game’s reputation, it’s Zombies. Treyarch continues to deliver compelling survival gameplay with evolving objectives, secrets, and high replay value. In its review, [IGN’s Zombies review](https://www.ign.com/articles/call-of-duty-black-ops-7-zombies-review) praises its satisfying progression and polished combat flow.

However, even with a strong showing from Zombies, the disappointing campaign casts a long shadow over Black Ops 7 as a whole. Fans expecting a narrative-driven experience comparable to Black Ops 1, 2, or Cold War may walk away feeling misled.

## Verdict: A Misfire That Struggles to Find Its Purpose
Black Ops 7’s campaign takes risks, but few of them pay off. Its ambitious co-op structure is held back by poor pacing, technical limitations, and baffling design decisions. While Zombies mode remains a highlight and multiplayer offers familiar fun, the campaign feels like a step backward for the franchise.

As a result, BO7 lands among the weakest narrative offerings in Call of Duty history.

**Final Score: 4/10**
