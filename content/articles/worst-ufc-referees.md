**Based on public and media scrutiny, here are three referees frequently labeled incompetent, along with supporting sources:**

## The Infamous Trio: Mazzagatti, Seljestad, and Yamasaki

Few names in MMA spark frustration among fighters and fans like Steve Mazzagatti, Dave Seljestad, and Mario Yamasaki.

- **Steve Mazzagatti** has been on the receiving end of harsh criticism from UFC President Dana White, who once called him *"dangerous with continued incompetence"*. His history of late stoppages and questionable calls has been documented in outlets like [Bleacher Report](https://bleacherreport.com/articles/1674811-dana-white-referee-steve-mazzagatti-is-dangerous-with-continued-incompetence).
- **Dave Seljestad** recently came under fire during UFC 307 for poorly handled eye pokes and untimely separations, prompting backlash from fans and fighters alike. [MMA News](https://www.mmanews.com/news/ufc/fans-slam-referee-eye-pokes-separations-ufc-307-fight/) reported the incident as a turning point in the call for higher officiating standards.
- **Mario Yamasaki** is notorious for letting fighters endure unnecessary punishment. His infamous "be a warrior" stance drew heavy criticism, and his reluctance to step in quickly has led to accusations of negligence.

Together, these referees represent the UFC's officiating low points—moments that shape not only fights but careers.

## When Bad Refereeing Changes Careers

The consequences of poor refereeing go far beyond a single fight result. Late stoppages risk permanent damage to fighters, while premature ones undermine years of training and preparation. For example, questionable enforcement of rules around fouls has repeatedly left fighters and their camps furious. [talkSPORT](https://talksport.com/mma/3499714/ufc-fighter-illegal-move-defeat-kiefer-crosbie/) highlighted a case where an illegal move changed the outcome of Kiefer Crosbie's fight, sparking debate over referee accountability.

Every mistake affects more than just the fighters—it alters rankings, paydays, fan perception, and in some cases, entire careers.

## Are UFC Referees Held Accountable?

Despite repeated controversies, the system for referee accountability remains opaque. Fans and media outlets argue for more oversight, yet governing bodies like athletic commissions often recycle the same officials regardless of their track records.

Some fighters and commentators have called for reforms, including stricter performance reviews, suspension for repeated mistakes, and more extensive referee training programs. The backlash from UFC 307 and past incidents involving Mazzagatti and Yamasaki are fueling those discussions louder than ever.

## Conclusion: A Call for Higher Standards

Referees in combat sports carry a heavy burden—the safety of athletes and the integrity of competition rest in their hands. While mistakes are inevitable, consistent lapses from certain referees have left lasting stains on the UFC's reputation.

As fighters continue to speak out and fans demand higher standards, the pressure is mounting on the UFC and athletic commissions to ensure only the most competent officials oversee fights. Until then, names like Mazzagatti, Seljestad, and Yamasaki will remain symbols of what fans dread most: the wrong call at the wrong time.
